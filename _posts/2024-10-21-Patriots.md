Write a detailed blog post about Patriots. Please use markdown syntax, include headings, bullet points, and a conclusion for better readability. This is a great way to create a concise blog post.

1. Use JSON

JSON is a common format for creating web pages and is very fast (e.g., 3200 bytes/sec). It's also a widely used encoding for JavaScript (in other words, JavaScript is the most important encoding for browsers to have, not Chrome and even not IE).

The above technique describes the basics of JSON, but we will cover it quickly.

2. Create a JSON document

Now we have a simple and elegant way to create JSON documents.

It might seem more obvious but here's what it does, it takes the content and changes it and makes it compatible with other popular formats such as XML files.

If we want to create a JSON file we have to change the file type parameter to HTML or.xml.

If you want to create documents we will also need the xml-only type parameter. That's because we'll create an XML file in our project that'll look something like this to create this JSON document:

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?> <head> <title>The new Wunderground</title> <meta name="wunderground" content="DATABASE:content"> <meta name="version" content="2016-09-25"> <meta name="description" content="The new Wunderground release features a new and better markup language which will ensure more flexibility, speed and security of web applications and documents that are used in future web-services, e.g., database, smart contracts or applications. Users will be able to write their own HTML based on the markup language of the document, but no writing by human, for example.</meta name> <meta name="description" content="The new Wunderground is an enhanced and expanded version of Wunderground Standard Language and includes a host of new rules and technologies including the use of the 'HTML:first' encoding and the HTML5 standard." id="new"> <meta name="version" content="2016-09-25"> <meta name="text-block-face" content="Content-Type:text/html"/> </head> <body class="wunderground:text
