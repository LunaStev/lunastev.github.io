Nebraska football is a storied program that has been a cornerstone of college football for over 100 years. Located in Lincoln, Nebraska, the Cornhuskers are one of the most successful and well-respected teams in the history of the sport. From iconic coaches to legendary players, Nebraska football has built a legacy that continues to inspire and captivate fans.

Origins and Early Success

The origins of Nebraska football can be traced back to 1890 when the team played their first game against the Omaha YMCA. The early years were filled with ups and downs, but things took a turn for the better when Fielding H. Yost was hired as head coach in 1898. Under Yost's leadership, the team went on a 60-game unbeaten streak, earning them the nickname "The Iron Men."

In 1906, Ewald O. Stiehm took over as head coach and continued the team's success, leading them to three consecutive Missouri Valley Conference titles. He also introduced the Nebraska Interlocking "N" logo, which is still used today. The 1920s saw Nebraska win six conference championships, establishing themselves as a powerhouse in the Midwest.

In 1962, Bob Devaney was hired as head coach, and he would go on to become the winningest coach in Nebraska football history. Devaney transformed the program, leading the team to five national championships, including back-to-back titles in 1970 and 1971. He also coached future NFL greats like Johnny Rodgers, Mike Rozier, and Dave Rimington.

After Devaney's retirement in 1972, Tom Osborne took over as head coach and continued the team's success. Over his 25-year tenure, Osborne coached powerhouse teams that won three national championships, 13 conference championships, and set countless records. Under Osborne's leadership, the Cornhuskers became a dominant force in college football.

The Tom Osborne Era also saw the team make a historic run from 1993-1997, winning three national championships and four conference titles. This period was marked by players like quarterback Tommie Frazier, who led the team to victory in the 1994 Orange Bowl and the 1995 and 1997 national championship games.
