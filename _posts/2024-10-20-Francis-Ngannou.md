Francis Ngannou is probably one of the most dominant heavyweight fighters in mixed martial arts (MMA) today. His incredible strength and power, coupled with his inspiring backstory, have made him a fan favorite and a force to be reckoned with in the UFC.

Born on September 5th, 1986 in the small village of Batie, Cameroon, Ngannou grew up in poverty and faced many challenges. At the age of 26, he decided to leave his home and pursue a better life in Paris, France. He initially worked in odd jobs to make ends meet but, after watching a UFC fight on TV, he became captivated by the sport and was determined to become a fighter.

In 2013, Ngannou started his MMA journey by training at a local gym in Paris. He quickly caught the attention of coaches and fellow fighters with his incredible physique and raw power. It didn't take long for him to make a name for himself in the European MMA scene, winning all six of his amateur fights by knockout.

In 2015, he made his professional debut and signed with the UFC in 2016. Ngannou's rise to the top was nothing short of remarkable. In just one year, he went from being a virtual unknown to a top-ranked heavyweight fighter. His devastating knockouts and impressive fighting skills quickly had people talking, and he was dubbed “The Predator” for his ferocious fighting style.

One of Ngannou's most notable fights was in 2017 when he faced former heavyweight champion Andrei Arlovski. Despite being the underdog, Ngannou knocked out Arlovski in the first round, solidifying his status as a top contender in the heavyweight division. He then went on to knock out Alistair Overeem in his next fight, further cementing his dominance in the UFC.

In 2018, Ngannou had his first title shot against then-heavyweight champion Stipe Miocic. The fight went the distance, and although Ngannou lost, it showed his resilience and determination to become a champion.

After a couple more ups and downs in his career, Ngannou seemed to have lost his steam. He went on a losing streak, and his performances were lackluster. But in 2019, he made a remarkable comeback. In a fight against legendary heavyweight boxer Cain Velasquez, Ngannou secured a knockout win in under a minute. This
